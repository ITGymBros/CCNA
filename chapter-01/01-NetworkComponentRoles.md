**End Points**, are devices that end users interact with on a network 
- Examples can be laptops, smart phones, tablets, etc.

**Servers**, are hardware or software that serves content to clients or endpoints without human interaction 
- Examples can be File Servers, Databases, Storage servers, etc.

What is needed for a wireless network?
- End Points
- Access Points
- Wireless LAN Controller

**Routers** are a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks[^1]

**Switches** are a networking device that forwards data packets within a single computer network[^2]

**Layer 2** is the second layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model that deals with the transferring of data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer[^3] 

**Layer 3** is the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model that deals with the transferring of variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network, while maintaining the quality of service requested by the transport layer[^4]

**Firewalls** are network security devices that monitor incoming and outgoing traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a set of rules[^5]

**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)** a security appliance that processes network traffic and applies rules to block potentially dangerous traffic[^6] 

**Network Controllers** are software that orchestrates network functions[^7]
