Auto MBIX with fix if the wrong cable is plugged in

Fiber Optic cables

![RJ-45 Connector](../docs/assets/chapter-01/sec05_image05.png)

The fiber optic with a smaller core is a single-mode fiber and the fiber optic with a larger core is called a multi-mode fiber

![RJ-45 Connector](../docs/assets/chapter-01/sec05_image06.png)

Single mode fiber 

![RJ-45 Connector](../docs/assets/chapter-01/sec05_image07.png)
*9/125 = single-mode*

Multi-Mode cable

![RJ-45 Connector](../docs/assets/chapter-01/sec05_image08.png)
*50/125 microns = multi-mode*

Fiber Optic Connectors

![RJ-45 Connector](../docs/assets/chapter-01/sec05_image09.png)
*Lucent Connector (LC) left, Subscriber Connector (SC) right* [^1]

You can tell a fiber optic is able to send data by shining the connector over the palm of your hand. **DO NOT** look into the connector directly as it can cause permanent damage to your eyes.

**DO NOT** tie fiber optics into a knot or loop them around as it can break the silicon glass inside the cable
