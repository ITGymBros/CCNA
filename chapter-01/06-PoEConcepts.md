**Power Over Ethernet (PoE)** is a technology that enables Ethernet cables to transmit data and power simultaneously using a single network cable[^1]

**Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)** is a device, equipment or product that supplies power to other devices on a PoE implementation[^2]

A PSE can be usually be one of two items:
- A switch with PoE capabilities
- A power injector

**Power Device (PD)** is a device that gets the power from a PSE

Some examples of PDs:
- VoIP phones
- Raspberry Pi
- Wireless access points

**Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)** is a Cisco proprietary protocol that is used for collecting directly connected neighbor device information like hardware, software, device name details and many more [^3]
