**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks [^1]

**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet [^2]
