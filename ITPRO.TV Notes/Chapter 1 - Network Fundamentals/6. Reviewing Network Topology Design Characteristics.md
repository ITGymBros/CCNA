### Difference between Network Topologies and Network Design Topologies

A Network Topology is essentially a map of the network describing how the network actually functions while Network Design Topology is a diagram/map showing how the network should be laid out and how it's **supposed** to properly function. It's about best practices and what we should actually end up doing. Network Design Topology is important and helpful to structure and design a network properly in the event you need to scale up and or scale out in the future.
