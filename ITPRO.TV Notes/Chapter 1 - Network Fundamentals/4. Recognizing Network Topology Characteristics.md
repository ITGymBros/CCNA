### Network Topology
* The arrangement of the systems/devices of a communication network
	* Used to describe the physical and logical structure of a network

* Topology types:
	* Bus Topology
		* Everything is connected through one wire
		* This allows all the devices to communicate with each other
		* Only one device can communicate at any one time, like standing in waiting your turn
		* This has physical limitations with how many devices that can be on the network
		* The Bus Topology is still used today
			* Used in wireless networks
	* Ring Topology
		* The ring topology is a network designed where connected devices form a circular data channel
			* Each networked device is linked to two more ones by two points on a circle
		* No congestion on the network
			* This was achieved through only allowing the device with the specific token to have the ability to communicate on the network
		* A big limitation of this type of network is the cost
	* Star Topology
		* Every device with a hardwired connection is connected directly to the switch
		* This network is designed to have a "central core" being the switch and many devices connected directly to the switch surrounding it
		* This allows for full bandwidth and better speeds
		* Most physical networks are laid out in the Star Topology

* Physical Topology
	* How the network devices are actually cabled together
* Logical Topology
	* How the network works to send data
Physical Topologies and Logical Topologies don't necessarily have to match. An example of this is having the physical network topology be the Star Topology, but the logical is the Bus Topology.
