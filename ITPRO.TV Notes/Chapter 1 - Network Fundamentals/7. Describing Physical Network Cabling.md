### Ethernet Cables
* Copper cabling
* What is "CAT" on an ethernet cable
	* Simply stands for category, to indicate what variant cable it's.
		* This is important to understand the cable's speed capabilities, shielding, and how far of a distance it can support said speed at
			* For example:
				* CAT-6 supports 1/10Gbps at 250MHz, can support 1Gbps up to 100m and 10Gbps from 37-55m (cable construction is either UTP or shielded)
				* CAT-7 supports 10Gbps at 600MHz for up to 100m (cable construction is shielded)
* RJ45 Connector
	* RJ stands for registered jack while the "45" refers to the listing number.
	* RJ45 is commonly known as the ethernet cable
		* The RJ45 connector is the commonly used connector for the ethernet cable
* 568A Straight Through Cable
	* Straight through cable is good for connecting a computer/device straight to a switch

* 568B Straight Through Cable
	* Achieves the same as the 568A straight through cable
	* Why is there an "A" and a "B" straight through cable?
		* Difference in standards, so make sure you're consistent with whichever type you use

* Crossover Cable
	* A crossover cable is a cable that has the 568A standard on one end and the 568B standard on the other end

			* On the 568A side, pin 1 (green-white) crosses over to pin 3 on the other side (568B) , while pin 2 (green) on the 568A side crosses over to pin 6 on the 568B side. Pin 3 on 568A (orange-white) crosses over to pin 1 on 568B and pin 6 (orange) on 568A crosses over to pin 2 on 568B
	* This cable allows connectivity from PC to PC, switch to switch, router to router, or router to PC

### Fiber Optic Cables
* Single Mode Fiber
	* Smaller core
		* 9 micron core
		* Light Source: Laser
* Multi Mode Fiber
	* Bigger core
		* Allows for the ability to send multiple light sources/wavelengths of light down this particular core
		* Light Source: LED
		* 62.5 micron core
* How to identify if a fiber optic cable is single or multi mode fiber
	* The labeling on the cable will indicate the diameter of the inner core
		* Example
			* 9/125 indicates out of the total 125 micron thickness of that cable, 9 microns is the thickness of the core so it has to be a single mode fiber cable
