The Cisco CLI is how you will configure and reconfigure Cisco devices. When you get a typical Cisco switch you will first have to connect to the switch via the console or USB cable to directly communicate and configure that switch. You can also connect and configure devices remotely over the network. The Cisco Operating System is Cisco IOS which can be found on both Cisco routers and switches.
